    <p>I was playing around with THREEJS but it was too complicated to learn in such short time.

    <h1><a href="tries/moonAPI/moon data generative/moon_circles/index.html">Narrative and voice I</a></h1>
    <p>
      This was the basis for my narrative and voice project. At first I thought about using a <a href="https://burningsoul.cloud/apis/moon">moon API</a>. But the moon as an astronomical object moves in enormous distances and timeframes. This means that the code had to run for ages for me to see any interesting movement. I found <a href="http://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/lunar/mk88-l-120cvf-3-rdr-120color-v1/mkls_0001/index/index.htm">this database</a> of some 'Lunar NIR Spectrophotometry' readings. The code runs throught the text files containing the data, stored in an external file ( had to use ajax to access the files ), and use the value it finds to create a drawing. Each value is adapted to change the radius and the color of each circle. When the code reaches the end of the file, it adds x to the y position of the circle, the x position returns to 0 and does the same with a new file.

    <p>
      This test uses the exact same concept as the previous example. Except that every three values represent the RGB values for the circles, respectively. Instead of each value changing the black gradient and circle radius, it changes only the colors. I didn't really like how this example was turning out so I only added one file to the fiddle.

    <p>
      This represents the exact same idea of <a href="tries/moonAPI/moon data generative/moon_circles/index.html">Narrative and voice I</a> except that the circles are now spheres. It also only changes the spheres' diameter as I wanted to keep the glare caused by the ambient light.
