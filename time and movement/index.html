        Julian Assange is the founder of WikiLeaks, which he founded in 2006. After the Chelsea Manning leaks in 2010, assange has been the target of investigations of many countries, specially the united states. He was arrested the same year by the British police, but was released on bail after a little more than a week. In 2012, however he breached his bail and was granted assylum by Ecuador. He has lived in the Ecuatorian embassy since.<br>

        The main concept of this portrait is the exploration of the limits of portraiture. How can a portrait be a portrait if the portraied is not present? The answer is not clear. Julian Assange is arrested in practice. I have no access to him at all. What I have, though is the images he provided through is medium of work. The internet, through which Assange shared the files that messed up the general trust in western governments for the years to come, would be the source for the face of my portraied<br>
        <br>
        I tried to find tools to 'create' the face of Julian Assange without him being present. What I found was a very crude program that enables the user to upload a front and side photograph of his face, and create a 3D model from it. The result was a very crude, hardly indentifiable Assange, with the logo of the program imprinted in his forehead as it was the best tool available to me to recreate a preson that is completely estranged from me.

    <h1>Reflection</h1>
    <p>
        At the end, I had two main doubts:<br>
        - If I was able to roughly create another person's face, using a free tool off the internet, how far could I go if I actually studied the subject? I made that face in less than three weeks. If I had a year, two years could I have completelly falsified a face, or a full person and release that video online?<br>
        <br>
        - In the feedback I was advised not to use a new program to create the 3D model used for the portrait. I know the model was crude and unaccurate but how far should I have sacrificed the concept of using the tools available to me online, as Assange did all his life, just not to have a red logo on his forehead?
