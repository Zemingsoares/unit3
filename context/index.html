          CONTEXT

        <div id="text">
          <p>
            The idea for this project came from my observations on how people need visual distractions or escapes to feel confortable. Even in their own homes.<br>
            I noticed a correlation between the fireplace, not as an instrument to warm our homes, but as a visual object and the television. And how both of these objects correlate in history as well as their role in human interactions in the living-room.<br>
            Both the TV and the fireplace are framed sources of light that provide an usefull escape for the eye in the case of unwanted or excessive human interaction. They provide safety and confort. The TV went further than the fireplace by transforming the living-room into an almost completely personal place where people can find company that, in a way, does not fight back.<br>
