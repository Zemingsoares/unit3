      <h1> CLAIR DE LUNE </h1>
      <p>
        Clair de Lune was composed by Claude Debussy, in 1890. Acording to wikipedia, "He and Maurice Ravel were the most prominent figures associated with Impressionist music, though Debussy disliked the term when applied to his compositions". My decision to create an album cover for this music was mostly because of my taste for it, but also because of that frase.<br>
        <br>
        Debussy was an icon of Impressionist music, but he disliked the term. I find that incredibly interesting, it would be like saying Stephen Hawking does not like to be called an theoretical physicist. Anyway, from the begging I felt the need to explore Impressionist painting in my illustration, but at the same time, contradict it directly in order to show the side of Debussy that does not want to be called an Impressionist.<br>

        Impressionism is based on color. It creates impressions solely using colors. In order to counteract the defining feature of the style, my first aestetic decision was to use as little color as possible. Using white on white was my first idea. It both goes against the norm both created and despised by Debussy, and perfectly represents the music he composed.<br>
        <br>
        Image wise, I focused on the title 'Clair de Lune' literally means 'moonlight'. Obviously the image of the moon came to my mind. That is why the moon is on the color tests and mockup of the first set of images. But it was way to obvious. It is not smart or chalenging. It is too obvious. I thought about ways of using details of the moon, maybe a crater, or the surface in general.

        But it was not quite there yet. It becomes too rough. It does not represent the subtlety and smothness of Debussy's creations.<br>
        <br>
        The images bellow show some color tests with the first idea. I was hoping that the white print on white paper would not be as faint as it came out. After I tried with other colors, I felt that using color for the illustration and transparent print of the title on the plastic sleeve would be enough to represent the idea of rejecting color.<br>

        This book was created by Katie Paterson. It was a project that consisted of a transmition of the Moonlight Sonata by Beethoven converted to morse code and sent in the direction of the moon's surface. The echo, reflected from the moon's surface is the result of the project.<br>
        <br>
        Bellow is an example of EME (earth - moon - earth communications) by the Dwingeloo Radio Observatory.

      <p>This example gave me the idea of not using the visuals of the moon at all, but using instead, the information on the moon available to me online.<br>
      <br>
      My first idea was to use an online API to create some kind of visuals for the album cover, and I did find a good one <a href="https://burningsoul.cloud/apis/moon">here</a>. the API gets new information every second or fraction of second from the telescopes or satellites they use for data gathering. And, as you can see, I have access to the age, illumination, stage, distance from center of the earth etc, etc. But using a live feed of data is a bit useless for a 2D solution ( unless I have a 2D screen kind of like they use in T-shirts <a href="http://www.lightinthebox.com/Sound-and-Music-Activated-Spectrum-VU-Meter-EL-Visualizer-LED-T-shirt--4-AAA-_p201117.html?currency=GBP&litb_from=paid_adwords_shopping&sku=2_289&utm_source=google_shopping&utm_medium=cpc&adword_mt=&adword_ct=191532684841&adword_kw=&adword_pos=1o1&adword_pl=&adword_net=g&adword_tar=&adw_src_id=8779303445_686902763_43366753322_pla-329742822884&gclid=CjwKEAjw_6XIBRCisIGIrJeQ93oSJAA2cNtMumn_Yuq-SzG4Z3J3Yvt6kaTj_YOl59jMOhWGFetH-xoCnITw_wcB">here</a> for example ). The flat screen was an idea that if I had access to, would have been my chosen idea. But I encountered a big problem with the API idea. Obviously, the moon is an astronomical object, and therefore it moves, shifts and changes in very large timeframes. It would cause some kind of visuals that are either way too linear or with unnoticeable changes in the timeframe of a week.<br>
      <br>
      This was the result of the moon live API:

      My solution for the 'boringness' of the ilustration was <a href="http://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/lunar/mk88-l-120cvf-3-rdr-120color-v1/mkls_0001/index/index.htm">this</a>:<br>

      <br>
      This is a database of readings of the spectrophotometry of the surface of the moon. This allowed me to have values that difered much more from each other, allowing me to create a set of visuals with visible changes in between them, instead of a visual that is the same throughout the canvas. Essencially, the code I created runs throught the text files containing the data, stored in an external file, and uses the value it finds to create a drawing. Each value is adapted to change the radius and the color of each circle. When the code reaches the end of the file, it adds x to the y position of the circle, the x position returns to 0 and does the same with a new file.<br>

        This one was my final choice. The circles perfectly represent the moon, and the overall illustration definitly represents the music very well. At the same time, I am using the literal moon light to create the visuals for the cover. I was very happy with the final idea.

        The final illustration ended up being printed of a very light blue paper. It allowed contradict the Impressionist norms as was my first idea of printing white on white. Using the light blue allowed me to have that visual of dim white on slightly colored paper, but at the same time, it doesn't seem like the paper is empty at the first glance.
