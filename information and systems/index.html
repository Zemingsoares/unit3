      <h1> POST TRUTH </h1>
      <p> 
        At the beginning of this project I was reading a book called ‘Black Transparency The Right To Know in the Age of Mass Surveillance’, by Metahaven, a small Dutch graphic design studio. It was a good coincidence as I consider Metahaven as the most aware organisation on this post truth era. At the same time, through their talks, books and interviews they seem completely eluded and unaware of the real world. As if post truth was a game or simulation. The group has a very proactive work policy, which allowed them to work with multiple international organisations. The one that is most important for the book and this project is Wikileaks. In 2010, the group created by Vinca Kruk and Daniel van der Velden proposed a new identity for WikiLeaks which was never realised but it created a precedent for later work with the same kind of organisation.<br>

        The book focuses on how the Internet allowed some level of absolute freedom of information. And WikiLeaks, on their hand, ‘organised’* that phenomenon by providing a platform for organised whistleblowing. It reflects on whether the Internet is actually a free place. A true, virtual and utopian anarchy in the center of modern civilisation. The Internet is, however, highly regulated and corporatised. Owned by companies like Google and Facebook that quite literally own most of the virtual space of the web, and are free to sell it between themselves.<br>
        <br>
        *as in corporatised, but by an organisation<br>

        <b>“How has surveillance and transparency affected the design process both for yourselves and in general?</b><br>
        Design is basically high-res censorship.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Please explain.</b><br>
        This is a bit of a provocation, obviously.<br>
        Design is coming from the decision to publish something, wherever that may be. Every decision to publish is also a decision to frame a message. And design is, however minimalist or baroque it is, often a decision not to do something, to leave something else out. What else is that than high-resolution censorship?” - <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/12/19/5223620/hi-res-censorship-metahaven-on-edward-snowden-and-rebranding-wikileaks">Metahaven interview for The Verge, by James Chae, 2013</a><br>

      <h1>True news Fake news</h1>
      <p>
      One of the most leaks from WikiLeaks that impressed me the most was the <a href="https://collateralmurder.wikileaks.org/"> Colateral Murder video </a>. It shows civilians being killed by the american military. What impressed me was not the killing. However insensitive it sounds, we all know innocent people die in military campaigns. Even though I agree that it needs to stop, and all of the culprits should be prosecuted, it was not the impressive part. What impressed me the most was how the american government defended itself, but not its defence specifically, because it was expected of them to defend their military. The thing that impressed me the most was how credible in their defence was, instead of swallowing their own tongue trying to hide and omit facts as they usually do in dodgy situations. The fact that both sides may not have been telling the truth was the fact that impressed me.<br>

      <p>
      <br>
      It was proven that WikiLeak actually leaked the video hiding all the scenes that could give credibility and ‘reasons’ for the military to shoot those civilians. The argument of the american government was that the civilians had professional video equipment, that could at the moment have mislead the soldiers into thinking the civilians were insurgents with RPG’s. If you see the video it actually looks like the camera man hiding behind the corner pointing the camera at the helicopter is aiming to shoot at the helicopter. In a war zone it seems like an ‘honest’ mistake. However you can see the troops shouting and insulting the people they are aiming at. Another turning point is when the soldiers find that the men in the ground were not armed, they actually try to help the injured and it sounds as if they recognise their mistake.<br>
      <br>
      Whether you agree with the Iraqi war is irrelevant for this specific situation. We all disagree with war and any sane person believes that the soldiers shouldn’t even be in that country. But, in that situation, both WikiLeaks and the american government lied to the public. They both used the same video to show evidence of their side of the story.<br>
      <br>
      My point here is how can I, using only one video, convey two different stories. Instead of showing an example of fake news and another of truthful news, I decided to show an example of a truth but no completely true, and a lie, but not completely false. Which one is which I am not sure.<br>

      <h1>Final idea</h1><br>
      <br>  
      <p>My main focus for the project is not particularly about the information itself, but more on how the information can be transmitted. The idea is about what happens after the internet is gone. Or worse, what happens after the internet is completely legislated by the governments WikiLeaks ( and others similar to it ) tries to protect the people from? How could the poster be the next viral medium of true officially unwanted information?</p><br>

        POST-PROJECT DISCOVERY
      </h1><br>
      <p>
        Metahaven actually used the same idea of using posters to share more than publicity. They worked for IMMI or Icelandic Modern Media Institute, an organisation that focuses in improving laws that protect freedom of data and speech. What Metahaven did for them was actually publicity for the institute, but more in a propaganda kind of way than in your face marketing or advertising kind of thing. That publicity along with very important political information creates very simple straight messages that resemble headlines that, if carefully and strategically applied in the real world, would spread information in a scale comparable with social media. Actually, if the posters were well positioned, they would definitely be incorporated into social media as a consequence. I defend that physical objects or campaigns have more potential to be transformed into viral sources of information than straight off digital campaigns. The fact that a physical object is limited to the physical space it ocupies makes people have a stronger tendency to try and share it because of the aparent privilege of the object being seen by a more limited number of people.
